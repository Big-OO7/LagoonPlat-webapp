# Implementation Summary - Interface Improvements

## Overview
Three major interface improvements have been implemented to enhance the data labeling platform workflow.

---

## ✅ Feature 1: Editable Task Prompt for Labelers

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `src/components/labeler/LabelerTaskDetail.tsx`

### Implementation:
1. Added `editedPrompt` state to store the labeler's version of the prompt
2. Converted the read-only prompt display to an editable textarea
3. Added visual indicator (✏️ Editable) when the field is editable
4. Disabled editing when task is reviewed or submitted (but not for revision_requested)

### User Experience:
- Labelers can now modify the task prompt to clarify their understanding
- Helps labelers take notes or rephrase instructions
- Read-only when submitted/reviewed to preserve context
- Fully responsive with proper focus states

## ✅ Feature 2: Reject/Request Edits Functionality

### Changes Made:
- **Files**:
  - `src/types/database.ts` - Added new status
  - `src/components/admin/SubmissionDetailModal.tsx` - Added reject button
  - `src/components/labeler/LabelerTaskDetail.tsx` - Handle revision state
  - `src/components/LabelerDashboard.tsx` - Status color mapping
  - `supabase/migrations/20251011000000_add_revision_requested_status.sql` - Database migration

### Implementation:

#### 1. New Status Type: `revision_requested`
- Added to TaskStatus enum in database types
- Created migration file to add to PostgreSQL enum

#### 2. Admin Review Interface Updates:
- Split "Mark as Reviewed" into two buttons:
  - **"Request Edits"** (Yellow) - Sets status to `revision_requested`
  - **"Approve & Mark Reviewed"** (Green) - Sets status to `reviewed`
- "Request Edits" requires feedback explaining what needs to be changed
- Confirmation dialog before sending back to labeler

#### 3. Labeler Interface Updates:
- Detects `revision_requested` status with `needsRevision` flag
- Shows orange alert box with admin feedback and instructions
- Re-enables form fields for editing
- Changes submit button to "Resubmit Task" with orange color
- Updates status color to orange throughout dashboard

### Workflow:
1. Admin reviews submission
2. Admin adds feedback and clicks "Request Edits"
3. Labeler sees orange "Revision Requested" banner with feedback
4. Labeler can edit their response
5. Labeler clicks "Resubmit Task"
6. Submission goes back to "submitted" status
7. Admin can review again (approve or request more edits)

## ✅ Feature 3: Batch Assignment Interface

### Changes Made:
- **Files**:
  - `src/components/admin/BatchAssignment.tsx` - New component
  - `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Added new tab

### Implementation:

#### 1. New Component: BatchAssignment
A full-featured batch assignment interface with:

**Left Panel - Task Selection:**
- Lists all tasks with title, description, status badges
- Checkbox selection for each task
- "Select All / Deselect All" toggle
- Visual highlighting for selected tasks (blue border + background)
- Shows task count and status

**Right Panel - Labeler Selection:**
- Lists all labelers by email
- Checkbox selection for each labeler
- "Select All / Deselect All" toggle
- Visual highlighting for selected labelers

**Bottom Panel - Assignment Summary:**
- Shows real-time count of selected tasks and labelers
- Calculates total assignments to be created (tasks × labelers)
- Dynamic status messages guiding the user
- "Assign Selected" button

#### 2. Features:
- **Multi-select**: Select multiple tasks and multiple labelers at once
- **Upsert logic**: Uses `upsert` with `onConflict` to handle duplicates gracefully
- **Status updates**: Auto-updates tasks from 'draft' to 'assigned'
- **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental mass assignments
- **Loading states**: Shows progress during assignment
- **Success feedback**: Clear confirmation after completion
- **Auto-refresh**: Reloads data after assignment

#### 3. Admin Dashboard Integration:
- Added "Batch Assign" tab between "Submissions" and "Users"
- Fully integrated with existing navigation
- Maintains consistent styling and UX patterns

### Benefits:
- Saves significant time when assigning multiple tasks
- Reduces repetitive clicking (previously: task → assign → task → assign)
- Clear visual feedback throughout the process
- Prevents errors with confirmation dialogs
- Scales well with large numbers of tasks/labelers

## Database Migration Required
